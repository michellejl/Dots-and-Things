### - ZSH Themes
My main shell is zsh, using [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/). I've created a few themes over time to keep myself entertained.

#### -- ducky
![ZSH Ducky Theme](/images/zsh-theme-ducky.png)

This theme shows the current version of node (8.9.1 in the screenshot). The current location (Dots-and-Things) is either from the home folder (~) or the root of a git folder. If you are in a git folder, the end [] will show the branch name with different symbols based on if the branch is clean/dirty.

#### -- magicalness
![ZSH Magicalness Theme](/images/zsh-theme-magicalness.png)

This theme shows the current version of node (8.9.1 in the screenshot). The current location (Dots-and-Things) is either from the home folder (~) or the root of a git folder. If you are in a git folder, a [] will show the branch name with different symbols based on if the branch is clean/dirty on the far right. On each new load of the shell, a different emoji will load.
